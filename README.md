## AtliQ Hardware: Advanced Excel Analytics for Business Insights

### Project Description:
AtliQ Hardware, a prominent consumer electronics company, is striving to sharpen its competitive edge by transforming raw data into actionable business insights. In this project, we've leveraged the power of Excel to perform an extensive analysis of AtliQ Hardware's sales, finance, and market data. By using advanced Excel functions such as VLOOKUP, XLOOKUP, Index Matching, Power Query, and Data Modeling, we created multiple insightful reports that aid in strategic decision-making across the company.

The dataset includes key dimensions such as dim_product, dim_customer, dim_market, and dim_date, as well as critical financial metrics like Cogs, Freight cost, Targets, and Fact_actual_estimates. Our analysis produced vital reports including the Customer Net Sales Report, Top and Bottom 5 Products, P&L FY, Top 5 Countries, Division Level Report, New Products Launched in 2021, GM % by Quarter, and Market Performance vs. Target.

These reports provide AtliQ Hardware with a comprehensive view of their performance across various domains, enabling them to optimize operations, identify trends, and capitalize on market opportunities. The insights generated from these Excel reports are designed to support the company in making informed decisions, thereby driving growth and enhancing their market position.
